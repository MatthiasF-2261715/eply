# Merged Frontend (Bolt UI + Old Logic)

**Base UI**: `project`  
**Imported logic from**: `frontend`

### What I did
- Copied the Bolt design project as the base.
- Imported logic folders from the old frontend into the Bolt structure.
- On filename conflicts, kept Bolt files and wrote the old version next to it with a `.from_old` suffix.
- Merged missing dependencies & scripts from the old project's package.json into the new one.

### Likely manual follow-ups
- Compare and integrate any `*.from_old` files into their corresponding Bolt component or route.
- Ensure environment variables exist.
- Check router setup and providers (Redux/Zustand/Context) are wired in `main.tsx` or `_app.tsx`.
- Run the app and resolve type errors.
